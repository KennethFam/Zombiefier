# Zombiefier

A “C” program that creates a number of zombies (1 through n) processes as
specified in the command line arguments to the program: zombiefier –n 10 creates 10
zombies. The program cleans up the zombies upon completion. Zombies
remain in the system until a signal (SIGCONT) is sent to zombifier.
